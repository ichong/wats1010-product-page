#Design Concept

I reviewed sites that have similar call to action to create an account and pay for their service, [**Jobtarget**](www.jobtarget.com) and [**Squarespace**](www.squarespace.com). I will have two buttons on the top for Login and Signup. I'll use the logo as the header and a call to action with the short description below the header similar to the two sites that have actions in the middle of the page. The testimonials will be on the bottom of the page after the features list and video. I've also created a [**Project Timeline**](http://ichong.github.io/project-hub/) to keep track of the progress.
